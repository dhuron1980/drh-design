		<p>Instead of copying and pasting our webs*ite conte*nt into a new template, I decided to optimize the content for potential graduate students. To do this right, though, I needed to know what types of information these students needed and when they needed it.</p>
		<h5>Research</h5>
		<p>I began by researching the decision-making process with a focus on choosing college programs. Using student profiles posted on our website, I developed user personas for our Counseling Psychology and School Psychology programs. This information helped develop questions for the next round of research.</p>
		<p>I intended to interview undergraduate students about their graduate school search process. Because I worked alone, I decided this approach would take too much time. Instead, I organized group journey mapping sessions with current graduate students and program faculty. The conversations and maps created during these sessions helped me see the search process from multiple perspectives.</p>
		<h5>Transforming Findings</h5>
		<p>My research showed that potential students visited our website during the early stages of their search. Our old site was hosting information students needed during the latter stages of their search or after they began the program. For the new site, I prioritized general program information, financial aid, research activities and information about the City of Houston. I am working to ensure program website copy reflects the unique motivations and qualities of their target student.</p>
		<h5>Future Projects</h5>
		<p>This project was motivated by the need to update our template. In the future, I will user test the template to determine if it meets the needs of our potential students. I also need more feedback from undergraduate students. One benefit of working for one department is the ability to design research projects that build on the findings of previous projects. With that in mind, my next effort will focus heavily on undergrads.</p>
