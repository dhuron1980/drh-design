				<p class="sectionIntro">The Impact Report was supposed to create buzz about the Department of Psychological, Health and Learning Sciences’ research and community efforts. For months, I wrote stories, gathered art and laid out all 20 pages of the magazine. The report was emailed to more than 100 program directors and chairs across the country and … nothing. The metrics we’d selected to track the report’s effectiveness — Facebook follows and website traffic — didn’t budge. Something had gone wrong.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-10 col-sm-8">
				<p class="lastGraph">Less than a year later, I was asked to draw up plans for a new version of the magazine. I was wary. Did our audience want this type of material delivered to their mailbox? Was there a better use of our limited resources, a better way to spread the word about our faculty’s hard work?</p>

				<h5 class="sectionHeader">Research</h5>
				<p>I had less than a week to develop a new plan, so I decided the quickest way to answer my questions was to develop a persona. This persona would paint a picture of a program director’s typical day and how they might react to receiving an unsolicited, 20-page magazine in the mail.</p>
				<p class="lastGraph">I decided the best surrogate for our audience were program directors within the University of Houston’s College of Education, which houses our department. I spoke with three directors about their work days, how they learned new information about their fields of study and how they reacted to emails and mailers from rival universities. I also studied our competition mailing list to gather simple demographic data about our audience.</p>

				<h5 class="sectionHeader">The Findings</h5>
				<p>Our user is a very busy woman, and her time is valuable. She is bombarded by literally thousands of emails every semester. She attends dozens of meetings. She reads and reads and reads — student assignments, research journals, article drafts. She’s mostly interested in learning about work that affects her research. She’s not likely to spend much time flipping through a magazine or reading a marketing email if she doesn’t see something related to her research interests.</p>
				<p class="lastGraph">I presented these findings to the Department Chair who agreed we needed to develop a different way of connecting with our audience. I began developing plans for the Impact Mailer. My plan was to design a one-sheet mailer which quickly outlined several of our research and community projects. At the end of the mailer, we would prompt the user to join our mailing list with promises of more quick stories delivered to their email inbox. We’d also provide the user the choice of several research categories, so she would only receive the information that mattered most to her.</p>

				</a>
			</div>
			<div class="col-10 col-sm-8">
				<p class="cutline">The print version of the Impact Mailer &#40;pictured here&#41; was distributed to 10 random directors on our mailing list. I developed an email version through Mail Chimp that was distributed to 10 random directors. Ten random directors recieved both versions of the mailer.</p>

			<div class="col-10 col-sm-8">
				<p class="cutline">I first developed a paper prototype of the newsletter signup process on paper and then digitally on Adobe XD. I tested and refined the process with the help of faculty members. In addition to the signup page, this footage features a mockup of the email stories users will receive.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-10 col-sm-8">
				<p class="lastGraph">After gaining approval for the project, I decided to run an A/B/C test to see if the printed or email version (developed through MailChimp) of the mailer influenced the user to sign up for our newsletter. Ten random users were sent print versions of the mailer, 10 received the email version and 10 received both.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-10 col-sm-8">
				<h5 class="sectionHeader">Results and Lessons</h5>
				<p>The results? No one signed up for the newsletter. After my frustration settled down, I began to study Google Analytics and the MailChimp data. The data showed that 5 of the 10 people who received both versions of the mailer clicked through to the newsletter signup webpage.</p>
				<p>This project taught us an important lesson: These types of campaigns take time. The audience needs to see your work, hear your message consistently before they deem you worthy of their valuable time and attention. We must be patient. We must be willing to experiment and test out ideas — different designs, different, calls to action — to see what best connects with our audience.</p>
				<h5 class="sectionHeader">Future Projects</h5>
				<p class="lastGraph">Moving forward, I want to expand on the persona I started. I want to speak with program directors outside of our college and outside our university to gain a deeper understanding of how they interact with direct marketing materials. In the end, our department’s standing amongst our colleagues begins and ends with our research. To improve our standing, though, we have to get people to read that research. That’s the … I’ve got nothing.</p>
