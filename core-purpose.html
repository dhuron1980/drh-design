				<p class="sectionIntro">There are only so many students who want to study school psychology or develop research methods or learn how people change during their lifetime. Programs across the nation are screaming for these students' attention, but eventually all that screaming starts to sound the same.</p>

				<p class="lastGraph">UH's Department of Psychological, Health and Learning Sciences was following the marketing template established by its competitors: list the degrees you offer, make note of your diverse students and/or faculty and wait for the students to do the rest. To differentiate ourselves from the competition and raise our national profile, we needed to go beyond simply stating what work we do. We needed to tell potential students why we do that work.</p>

				<h5 class="sectionHeader">Research</h5>
				<p>Inspired by Simon Sinek's <i>Start with Why</i>, I decided to interview faculty about what motivates their work and develop a Core Purpose Statement. This statement would help shape the department's marketing game plan. It would help us go beyond the "what" of our research and community work and add real humanity to our story.</p>
				<p>With the support of the Department Chair, I scheduled several story gathering interviews with our department's faculty. Each interview consisted of three questions and was designed to last about 10 minutes. I kept the interviews short, because I didn't want long interviews to detract faculty from talking with me.</p>
				<p class="lastGraph">Because these sessions were so short, I decided to begin each interview with a question that forced the faculty member to think creatively and strategically about their answer. I asked the participant to write down three words that described what motivated them to become the professional they are today. I then asked them to tell me about the proudest moment of their career and the lessons they hoped to impart upon the people they worked with.</p>

			<div class="col-10 col-sm-8">
				<p class="lastGraph">I began drafting the core purpose statement which consists of two parts: the contribution our organization makes to the world and the impact of that contribution. I sent a short survey to the department chair and program directors asking for their input on how closely the draft statement reflected our departmentâ€™s work. Besides suggesting tweaks to its language, they believed the statement hit the mark.</p>

				<h5 class="sectionHeader">Presentation Development</h5>
				<p class="lastGraph">Before I could present my work to the department as a whole, the Department Chair made an interesting point. If the Core Purpose Statement was supposed to help present our research in a more relatable and human way, wouldn't the faculty buy into the concept more if they could see an example of it at work? Immediately we thought of Dr. Keller-Margulis, a faculty member who'd recently spoken to the department about her research. The presentation she'd given was interesting but still so specialized that it risked confusing people outside her field. I asked Dr. Keller-Margulis if she would work with me on the project, and she was ready for the challenge.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-10 col-sm-8">
				<p>We began by recording her original presentation. We worked together to establish goals for her presentation and determined our ideal audience. It was important for both of us to develop a presentation that was scientifically strong yet approachable. This was very important to Dr. Keller-Margulis who feared that many potential doctoral students didn't get her work or why it was important.</p>
				<p class="lastGraph">Using the Core Purpose Statement as a framework, we discussed her work and the stories that inspired her to pursue her research interests. Together we developed an outline. We iterated her presentation several times, cutting, adding and rearranging elements until she was finally ready to give her final presentation.</p>

			<h5 class="sectionHeader">Impact</h5>
				<p>I presented the Core Purpose Statement and Dr. Keller-Margulis' new presentation to the department faculty both of which were greeted with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, that enthusiasm has yet to turn into more opportunities to consult with faculty members like I did with Dr. Keller-Margulis. When working with faculty on new brochures or website updates, I work to ensure they always keep the people they hope to help at the top of mind.</p>
				<p class="lastGraph">More directly, the statement has influenced how I write about our programs. Simply stating that we have this program wonâ€™t help us stand out in such a competitive market. Iâ€™m working to ensure we always mention how and why the work our faculty does can help make our world a better place to live. The following is an example of this approach in action:</p>
